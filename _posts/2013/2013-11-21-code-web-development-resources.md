This wordless digital comics experiment had to start somewhere. The 24 June 2013, with zero coding skills, I set out to design a WordPress theme to showcase comics. My first day as a *‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù* (not quite) began after installing a local test server. Bootstrapping, my goal was to learn enough about how code works, to design a basic comics site prototype from scratch. Since then, I work on this in my spare time, between drawing stories and various freelance assignments. Until I find an answer to the specific needs of this project, here is a compilation of the most useful links gathered in the process.

## Learning Code

If code is the future, you might as well learn about it.
One of the best way to do that is to start experimenting with something small first, like a personal website.
Here are some learning resources links to get started and return to often:

‚òû [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
Codecademy is a great place to start with the basics. Learn html, CSS, php, and JavaScript.

‚òû [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)
freeCodeCamp is an open source community of people who learn to code and help nonprofits.

‚òû [CodePen](http://codepen.io)
Codepen is a site where designers and developers test and share chunks of markup.

‚òû [GitHub](https://github.com)
GitHub started with a well thought out user interface for *social coding*. Now it host a huge chunk of
code.

‚òû [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)
Stack Overflow is resourceful Question and answer site for programmers, professionals or enthusiasts.

‚òû [teach yourself to code](http://teachyourselftocode.com)
A learning site by [Kate Ray](https://twitter.com/kraykray)

‚òû [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/)
Code School

‚òû [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/)

‚òû [Gomix](https://gomix.com/), by Fog Creek, let you see the code behind an application or website, tweak it an play with it in a built-in editor in the browser.

## Markup software editors

**Any Text Editor**
You can write code with any text editor. TextEdit, for instance or any similar basic word processing software will do. In fact, it is arguably the best way to learn: writing every line of code without shortcuts and without relying on the bell and whistle of more sophisticated applications. Here are three text editors I have used.

‚òû [ATOM](https://atom.io)
Atom is an open source text editor originating from GitHub. With hundreds of plugins extensions it is quickly becoming a favourite.

‚òû [Coda 2](https://www.panic.com/coda/)
A text editor aimed at designers to speed development.

‚òû [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)
A fantastic tool to test websites on a local server across multiple devices. You don't use it to write code but to compile, streamline, optimise everything from code files to images when you build your website or application.

There are many other options out there: [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim"), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime Text") are among the preferred.

With so many to choose from, this article will help you narrow down your choices: [The Best Text Editors Compared](https://makeawebsitehub.com/best-text-editors-compared-vim-stack/) ‚Äî A review of some of the most popular text editors. See also [What is the best text editor for programming?](https://www.diffur.com/q/what-is-the-best-text-editor-for-programming "What is the best text editor for programming?")

## CSS pre-processor
So, if Cascading Styles Stylesheet (CSS) weren't enough you could also get familiar with things like CSS pre-processors. SASS, LESS, Stylus, are CSS pre-processors. A pre-processor extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, *mixins*, functions and many other techniques to help you to write CSS easier to maintain, modify and extend. This can either make your life easier or more complicated üòÇ.

### Using Less CSS

Ok, so if you want to use LESS, start here: [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org).

### Using Sass

If you'd rather use Sass, start here: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).

You can also try the [Online JavaScript/CSS/HTML Compressor](http://refresh-sf.com)

### Postcss
Based on the same principles of preprocessors such as Sass and LESS, Postcss uses JavaScript to automate routine CSS operations.
