Quick notes before launch. [SILENT COMICS](https://silent-comics.com) is a personal attempt to simplify reading comics on screens as an alternative to cluttered webcomics.
{: .notice}

### How can you make reading comics easier?

First, let’s skip the *reading* part. Strip the strips of text. Remove speech bubbles. Why read comics that you can just *watch*?

Second, use a simple grid.

Last, don’t be afraid of [*decompression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_(comics)).

### Simple constraints

* no text
* a single ratio panel format
* long-form divided into small episodes

### Panel to panel reading
Here is how this could work: click on an image in full screen to watch. You can either use touch gesture or keyboard navigation [^1].

### Why do we need this?
SILENT COMICS celebrate the return of a simple form, drawing inspiration from silent films as well as from the origins of the comic-book medium.

Today in the digital age, wordless comics present an opportunity to re-explore the format[^2] as a visual-only narrative, and revisit the roots of a genre that started with picture books, perhaps even earlier, wherever comics-strips originated from[^3].

[^2]: Not merely transposing the comic page from paper to screen but taking advantage of the electronic form’s own possibilities and limitations.
[^3]: Leave it to scholars to determine whether The Lascaux caves were or weren’t sequential, and whether hieroglyphs from Egypt, the Trajan column, Ars moriendi, Hokusai Manga, or Rodolphe Töpffer were indeed the precursors of a tradition that led to Arzach.

### Definitions
Sometimes going back to definitions help us realize things were not exactly what we thought they were. In turn, the origin of a word can also inspire new ideas.

"Revel" sounds promising! Lets take a look at what it means:
{: .notice}

> **revel** |ˈrɛv(ə)l|
verb (**revels, revelling, revelled;** US **revels, reveling, reveled**) [ no obj. ]
enjoy oneself in a lively and noisy way, especially with drinking and dancing: (as noun **revelling**) : *a night of drunken revelling.*
• (**revel in**) gain great pleasure from (a situation): Bill said he was secretly revelling in his new-found fame.
noun (**revels**)
lively and noisy enjoyment, especially with drinking and dancing.
ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French **reveler ‘rise up in rebellion’**, from Latin **rebellare ‘to rebel’.**

***

There is indeed a healthy association between comedy and rebellion. This shows in the history of comics, from their infancy to their heyday.
