If you are interested about the SILENT COMICS projectâ€™s latest developments, you can follow the experiment progress, thanks to a simple text file[^1]. The file is updated as the project goes. You can view it here:

<div markdown="0"><a href="/Silent-Comics-Project-Progress-Graph.html" class="btn btn--light">progress.txt</a></div>
<br>
<figure>
	<a href="/images/Silent-Comics-Project-Progress-Graph.png"><img src="/images/Silent-Comics-Project-Progress-Graph.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Tracking progress 01</figcaption>
</figure>

Simple text-based project management: done. Next: drawing the comics.
