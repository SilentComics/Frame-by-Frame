## For Development Use

### Developer
[Developer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/), a plugin to help WordPress developers work in a local environment. It has various complementary tool for debugging, translation, right to left reading, accessibility testing etc.

### Query Monitor
[Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) by [John Blackbourn](https://johnblackbourn.com) is an excellent complement to developer tools. It filters database queries and provides with an extensive report, sorted by query type, function etc. For example, it can help you finding slow queries or conflicting plugins.

### Theme-check
[Theme Check](http://ottopress.com/wordpress-plugins/theme-check/) scans a theme and runs test based on WordPress.org Theme Review Team. It gives you hints about what is required to comply to WordPress.org standards.

### (WordPress Beta Tester)
[https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) by [Peter Westwood](http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/)
Once enabled this plugin switches your site onto the latest WordPress development version.

WordPress lets you update to the latest nightly build automatically, so you can test the latest version in development without this plugin.

## For live sites use

### WP2Static
[WP2Static](https://wp2static.com) exports WordPress as a static website


### Simple Cache
[Simple Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cache/)
by [Taylor Lovett](http://taylorlovett.com) as its name implies is a response to the lack of a *simple* cache plugin.

### Royalslider
[RoyalSlider](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/) - Touch Content Slider for WordPress by [Dmitry Semenov](http://dimsemenov.com/) Likely one the most robust slider plugin available in active development. Support is great too: [http://help.dimsemenov.com](http://help.dimsemenov.com)


### Regenerate Thumbnails
[Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/), by [Alex Mills](https://alex.blog/) regenerates the thumbnails for all your image attachments.This is useful for instance when you change the thumbnails sizes in your templates, i.e. if you use a custom function like ```get_first_image```.

### WordFence Security
[WordFence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/ "WordFence Security plugin on WordPress.org") is a 100% free and open-source security software supported by a large team dedicated exclusively to WordPress security.

### MailChimp integration
[MailChimp for WordPress Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/) by [Danny van Kooten](https://dannyvankooten.com/) works flawlessly.

### WooCommerce
WooCommerce is a popular plugin for small sites and indie developers. It is now part of Automattic after its [2015 acquisition](https://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/). The basic plugin is free, with more options available as paid features. Theme integration is not that complicated but time consuming. Granted, e-commerce on a small self hosted WordPress site can be a bit of a headache.

### Jetpack
I only use it for one of its multiple features but it deserves a mention for posting in Markdown alone.

## Discontinued plugins
Sometimes, good things come to a stop. Here are some plugins that were promising but are no longer supported or were abandoned by their authors.

### BruteProtect
[BruteProtect](http://bruteprotect.com) â€” once a must-use plugin, is now part of [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/).

### Scroll Kit
[https://wordpress.org/plugins/scrollkit/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scrollkit/)
This plugin enabled designing posts or pages from the Scroll Kit interface [^1].

[^1]: Sadly, Scroll Kit development was discontinued after its acquisition by Automattic in April 2014.
