This is a call to comic-book lovers. Please take a minute to answer a few questions about e-book formats. What do you think about e-book pricing and distribution? Which online publishing platforms do you go to for reading comics? What devices do you prefer to read digital comics? How does reading comics on screen compare with print?

Interesting replies and comments so far. For instance, I had no idea Comic book archive (.cbr) was so popular. Itâ€™s not even a distinct format, just a folder filled with images files. Of course, people do use digital comics readers but the questionnaire overlooked this topic. Some of the entries are priceless though, like this one:

> Please don't spam me about your wordless comic. If it is good I will find it.

ðŸ˜ƒ *Great advice!
