{% include toc title="Silent Comics Manifesto" icon="file-text" %}

*for simple digital comics*

With the idea that creativity emerges from constraint, here are the SILENT COMICS project constraints:

## 1. Wordless
Strip the strips from text[^1] to let the drawings do the talking.

[^1]: Remove all dialogues, captions, and onomatopoeia. Elements of text visible in the setting of a scene are fine.  For instance, letters painted on a wall, or a graffiti in the background in a particular story are ok as visual elements. Chapter numbers, subtitles, ISBN, text identifying the book title and its author are acceptable.

## 2. One Frame Fits All
The story reads a single panel[^2] at a time on any device, filling the screen or the page. Each frame must have the same ratio throughout the whole story to ease online viewing.

[^2]: By design, the online version uses the panel as the smallest unit. The panel ratio is also the base for the grid of future print version.

## 3. Long Form
Long stories divided into small chunks[^3].

[^3]: Each post tells a chapter or episode in 12 to 24 panels, very much unlike the three or four panels cartoons of daily strips. Daily strips are a format apart and different. Brevity makes them perfect for the web. Long-form requires more attention and effort from the audience.

## 4. Freestyle Graphics
Any[^4] graphic styles or techniques will do as long as pictures tell a story in sequences.

[^4]: Traditional tools can give a touch of human fallibility to seamless digital interfaces. Original artwork on paper could be a good idea, but there are no rules.

## 5. Add Music
In the spirit of silent films, you can watch SILENT COMICS with accompanying music[^5].

[^5]: Better yet, pick and share your own musical choice for each story or even compose an original soundtrack yourself.

## 6. No advertising
Advertising-based revenue is not a viable model for webcomics. Nor should it be.

## SILENT COMICS is like silent films for comics.

The result is [SILENT COMICS](https://silent-comics.com), a collection of visual stories in the making.
